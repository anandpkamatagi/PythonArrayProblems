# Given an array of integers arr[], move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of all non-zero elements.

# Examples: 

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
# Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
# Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

# Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
# Output: [10, 20, 30]
# Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

# Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
# Output: [0, 0]
# Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
